UART interface protocol description:

Server (PC) sends text commands to the ROM emulator (arduino mega). 

Commands: 
"s\n" CLK stop - this command will stop the clock signal at low state
"r\n" CLK run - will resume clock cycle 
"x\n" reset - will perform a reset procedure (pull reset signal high, then pull low), will also resume the clock signal 
"cN\n" - set clock speed N = {0,1,2,3,4}, 3 and 4 without monitor output
"n\n" - single step
TBD "b A\n" - set breakpoint (will stop the clock) on address A 
TBD "B A\n" - clear breakpoint 
":INTEL_HEX\n" - will stop the clock and write to the emulated "ROM" memory provided data, this command will check the check-sum and possibly return an error message
"d\n" - dump emulated ROM memory

Output: 
there are three types of responses: monitor output, command execution result and ROM memory dump

Ready message:
"!ready\n" - this message is send after emulator initialization

Monitor output 
every clock cycle the address bus and data buss are monitored and dumped on the serial port
"CC AAAA DD\n" 
where AAAA (address) is a 16 bit hexadecimal number and DD (data) is a 8-bit hexadecimal number
CC is a 8-bit hexadecimal number describing the state of control signals (RW, CE_ROM, CE_RAM, CE_KB, CE_LCD, ....)

Command result
"!ok\n" - for success
"!err MSG\n" - for error with a string message

Every error will stop the clock automatically.

ROM memory dump
":DD ..." - for every ROM byte
