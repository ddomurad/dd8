- refactor value resolving 
expressions should be resolved as late as possible 
names are part of the expression 
definitions only register expressions 
eg.
.def V1 := 1 + 2 
.def V2 := V1 * 2 ; => resolve_value_of{1 + 2}*2 


- functions 
eg. lcdenc("test string")

- custom temlates 

- do not allow for e.g. lda [0x10], x
- add [rjmp] to relative jump instruction 
- make [addr] to be the calculated relative jump
e.g: bbr 0, 0x10, [0x01] ; would jump one byte
     jmp [-0x02] ; would jump two bytes back
