- math instructions 
 (, ), +, -, *,/, <<, >>, %

- functions 
eg. low(0xaaaa) or high(NAME)
eg. lcdenc("test string")

- custom temlates 

- do not allow for e.g. lda [0x10], x
- add [rjmp] to relative jump instruction 
- make [addr] to be the calculated relative jump
e.g: bbr 0, 0x10, [0x01] ; would jump one byte
     jmp [-0x02] ; would jump two bytes back
