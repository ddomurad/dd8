- functions 
eg. some_func("test string")

- custom temlates 

- it is not possible to declare a non zero page opcode accesing zero page 
e.g. lda 0x0000 will be interpreted as lda 0x00

- do not allow for e.g. lda [0x10], x
- add [rjmp] to relative jump instruction 
- make [addr] to be the calculated relative jump
e.g: bbr 0, 0x10, [0x01] ; would jump one byte
     jmp [-0x02] ; would jump two bytes back


- update listing with template opcodes
