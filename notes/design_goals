Some design goals might be unrealistic

- 8 bit computer 
- Min ROM, max RAM - the system should be mostly RAM based. The ROM should function as a store for default font and common sub-routines. 
- OPTIONAL 2x 3.5 inch driver 
- OPTIONAL 1x SD card slot
- 1x Extension slot (can be used as cartridge, extra ram, or extra peripherals)
- 2x serial ports (one with the possibility to act as a terminal device) 
- Few I/O outputs (PWM, Analog input, Digital, I2C buss)
- PS2 Keyboard input 
- Video output (specs to be defined), VGA signal
- Sound output (3 channels, similar to sid chip), headphones + build in speaker (optional) 
- CPU Clock 12.5Mhz (half vga 25Mhz) if RAM/ROM allows 
- Real Time Clock
- Hardware timer
- Harder random number generator
- Multiplication coprocessor
